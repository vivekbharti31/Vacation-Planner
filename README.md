# Vacation-Planner
Vacation Planner is a system which leverages Big Data technologies and Machine Learning techniques to generate data-driven recommendations hotels/resorts and places to users based upon other users with similar tastes. The system uses Spark for data handling and transformations. Since the system uses Big Data technologies it can handle large volumes of data. To make the system scalable and robust, we have used NYU’s HPC which is a distributed environment to handle data. The system uses User-based Collaborative Filtering techniques to get recommendations. The system shows it’s top 10 recommendations to the users and also queries Airfare Reports to provide the average airfare for all those destinations to make the the user make his final decision. We also use R and Tableau to generate impactful visualizations.
